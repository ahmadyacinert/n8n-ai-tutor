    "prompt": " You are an AI teacher. I am a complete beginner who has just learned 'What is AI and how it affects our daily lives?'. My next topic is 'Machine Learning: The Core of How AI Learns'. Please explain this topic to me in a way that I can understand it in about 1 hour of focused learning.\nStructure your explanation as follows:\nIntroduction (5 minutes): Briefly define Machine Learning and explain why it's often called the 'brain' or 'learning engine' of AI, using a simple analogy.,\nThe Big Idea: Learning from Data (15 minutes):\nExplain the concept of 'learning from data' rather than explicit programming.,\nUse an everyday example (like teaching a child to recognize a cat) to illustrate this.,\nIntroduce the terms 'data' and 'patterns'.,\n,\nMain Types of Machine Learning (20 minutes):\nSupervised Learning: Explain what it is, using examples like spam detection or house price prediction. Mention 'labeled data'.,\nUnsupervised Learning: Explain what it is, using examples like customer segmentation or finding hidden patterns in data. Mention 'unlabeled data'.,\nReinforcement Learning: Explain what it is, using examples like training a robot to walk or a game-playing AI. Mention 'rewards' and 'punishments'.,\nKeep these explanations high-level and and focus on the core idea of each type.,\n,\nA Glimpse into the ML Process (10 minutes):\nBriefly touch upon the basic steps: collecting data, training a model, making predictions. Keep it very simple, like a recipe.,\n,\nWhy is ML so Powerful? (5 minutes):\nSummarize the benefits: automation, pattern recognition, prediction, adaptation.,\n,\nQuick Check & Next Steps (5 minutes):\nAsk me one simple question to check my understanding.,\nSuggest what I might want to explore next (e.g., 'What is a Neural Network?').,\n,\nThroughout your explanation:\nUse simple language and avoid jargon where possible. If jargon is necessary, explain it immediately.,\nUse clear, relatable analogies.,\nEncourage me to ask questions at any point.,\nAssume no prior technical knowledge beyond our last topic."

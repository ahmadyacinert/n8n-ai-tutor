    "level":"Beginner",
    "lesson_structure":"Introduction (5 minutes): Briefly define Machine Learning and explain why it's often called the 'brain' or 'learning engine' of AI, using a simple analogy.,The Big Idea: Learning from Data (15 minutes):Explain the concept of 'learning from data' rather than explicit programming.,Use an everyday example (like teaching a child to recognize a cat) to illustrate this.,Introduce the terms 'data' and 'patterns'.,,Main Types of Machine Learning (20 minutes):Supervised Learning: Explain what it is, using examples like spam detection or house price prediction. Mention 'labeled data'.,Unsupervised Learning: Explain what it is, using examples like customer segmentation or finding hidden patterns in data. Mention 'unlabeled data'.,Reinforcement Learning: Explain what it is, using examples like training a robot to walk or a game-playing AI. Mention 'rewards' and 'punishments'.,Keep these explanations high-level and and focus on the core idea of each type.,,A Glimpse into the ML Process (10 minutes):Briefly touch upon the basic steps: collecting data, training a model, making predictions. Keep it very simple, like a recipe.,,Why is ML so Powerful? (5 minutes):Summarize the benefits: automation, pattern recognition, prediction, adaptation.,,Quick Check & Next Steps (5 minutes):Ask me one simple question to check my understanding.,Suggest what I might want to explore next (e.g., 'What is a Neural Network?')."

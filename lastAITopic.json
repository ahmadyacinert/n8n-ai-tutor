    "lesson_structure":"You are an AI teacher with expertise in Machine Learning and Neural Networks, creating a 1-hour lesson for a beginner. This student has just completed an introductory lesson on 'Machine Learning: The Core of How AI Learns,' which covered ML definition, learning from data, main types (supervised, unsupervised, reinforcement), a glimpse into the ML process (collect, train, predict), and ML's power. Your task is to explain 'Neural Networks: How AI Thinks Like a Brain.' Structure the lesson to be comprehensive yet easy to understand within 60 minutes.

**Lesson Objectives for the Student:**
1.  Understand what a Neural Network is and its inspiration.
2.  Identify the basic components of a Neural Network (neurons, layers, connections, weights, biases).
3.  Grasp the fundamental idea of how a Neural Network learns from data.
4.  Recognize the types of problems Neural Networks excel at.
5.  Appreciate the power and potential of Neural Networks in AI.

**Lesson Structure (60 minutes):**

*   **Introduction (5 minutes):**
    *   Recap: Briefly connect back to ML and pattern recognition.
    *   Introduce Neural Networks (NNs): What they are and their "brain-inspired" idea.
    *   Why NNs are important: The foundation of Deep Learning.
*   **The "Neuron": The Basic Building Block (10 minutes):**
    *   Analogy: Compare to a single decision-maker.
    *   Explain inputs, weights, summing function, activation function, output. Keep it conceptual.
*   **From Neurons to Networks: Layers and Connections (15 minutes):**
    *   Illustrate how multiple neurons form layers (input, hidden, output).
    *   Explain how layers connect and pass information forward.
    *   The concept of "weights" and "biases" as what the network "learns."
*   **How a Neural Network Learns: The Core Idea (15 minutes):**
    *   Forward Propagation (Making a guess): How data moves through the network to produce an output.
    *   The "Error" or "Loss": How we know if the guess was wrong.
    *   Backpropagation (Learning from mistakes): Briefly explain how the error is used to adjust weights and biases (like refining a recipe). Avoid deep math; focus on the iterative adjustment idea.
    *   Analogy: Training a child, adjusting actions based on feedback.
*   **Types and Applications (10 minutes):**
    *   Briefly mention Feedforward NNs as the basic type.
    *   Touch upon what they're good at (image recognition, natural language processing) with simple examples.
    *   Why they are so powerful (finding complex, non-linear patterns).
*   **Limitations and Future (5 minutes):**
    *   Briefly touch on challenges (data, computational power, "black box").
    *   Outlook: The ongoing evolution.
*   **Quick Recap & Next Steps:** Summarize key takeaways and suggest topics like "Deep Learning" or "Convolutional Neural Networks."

**Delivery Style:**
*   Use clear, simple language and avoid jargon where possible. If jargon is necessary, explain it immediately.
*   Employ relatable analogies throughout (e.g., decision-making, recipe, teaching a child).
*   Maintain an encouraging and engaging tone.
*   Focus on conceptual understanding rather than mathematical detail."

    "level":"Beginner",
    "prompt":"You are an AI teacher. I am a complete beginner who has just finished learning 'Machine Learning: The Core of How AI Learns'. My next topic is 'Neural Networks: How AI Models 'Think' and 'Learn''. Please explain this topic to me in a way that I can understand it in about 1 hour of focused learning.

Structure your explanation as follows:

Introduction (5 minutes): Briefly define Neural Networks (NNs) and explain why they are a powerful type of Machine Learning model, using a simple analogy like a team of specialized workers solving a problem together. Mention their inspiration from the human brain.

The Big Idea: Layers of Decisions (15 minutes):
Explain the concept of 'neurons' (also called 'nodes') as simple decision-makers and 'layers' (input, hidden, output) as groups of these neurons.
Illustrate how information flows through these layers, building up from simple observations to complex conclusions, using an example like recognizing an object.
Introduce 'weights' and 'biases' simply as adjustable "settings" or "dial-tuners" that influence each neuron's decision.

How They Learn: Adjusting the Settings (20 minutes):
Connect back to 'learning from data' from our last topic.
Explain the training process: an NN makes a guess, compares it to the correct answer (feedback), and then subtly adjusts its 'weights' and 'biases' (its settings) to reduce future errors.
Use an analogy like tuning a musical instrument or adjusting ingredients in a recipe until it tastes right.

A Glimpse into Deep Learning (10 minutes):
Briefly introduce Deep Learning as Neural Networks with many 'hidden layers'.
Explain why having more layers allows NNs to learn incredibly complex and abstract patterns (e.g., from recognizing lines and edges to entire faces or objects).
Give real-world examples of where Deep Learning excels (like advanced image recognition, understanding speech, or generating text).

Why are NNs (and Deep Learning) so Powerful? (5 minutes):
Summarize their key benefits: ability to learn complex patterns automatically, high performance in many AI tasks, and their adaptability.

Quick Check & Next Steps (5 minutes):
Ask me one simple question to check my understanding about the core idea of how NNs learn.
Suggest what I might want to explore next (e.g., 'The Importance of Data in AI and ML' or 'How do AI models make predictions?').

Throughout your explanation:
Use simple language and avoid jargon where possible. If jargon is necessary, explain it immediately.
Use clear, relatable analogies.
Encourage me to ask questions at any point.
Assume no prior technical knowledge beyond our last topic on Machine Learning."

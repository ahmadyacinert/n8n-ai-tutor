    "level":"Beginner",
    "lesson_structure":"*   **Introduction (5 minutes):**    *   Recap: Briefly connect back to ML and pattern recognition.    *   Introduce Neural Networks (NNs): What they are and their 'brain-inspired' idea.    *   Why NNs are important: The foundation of Deep Learning.*   **The 'Neuron': The Basic Building Block (10 minutes):**    *   Analogy: Compare to a single decision-maker.    *   Explain inputs, weights, summing function, activation function, output. Keep it conceptual.*   **From Neurons to Networks: Layers and Connections (15 minutes):**    *   Illustrate how multiple neurons form layers (input, hidden, output).    *   Explain how layers connect and pass information forward.    *   The concept of 'weights' and 'biases' as what the network 'learns.'*   **How a Neural Network Learns: The Core Idea (15 minutes):**    *   Forward Propagation (Making a guess): How data moves through the network to produce an output.    *   The 'Error' or 'Loss': How we know if the guess was wrong.    *   Backpropagation (Learning from mistakes): Briefly explain how the error is used to adjust weights and biases (like refining a recipe). Avoid deep math; focus on the iterative adjustment idea.    *   Analogy: Training a child, adjusting actions based on feedback.*   **Types and Applications (10 minutes):**    *   Briefly mention Feedforward NNs as the basic type.    *   Touch upon what they're good at (image recognition, natural language processing) with simple examples.    *   Why they are so powerful (finding complex, non-linear patterns).*   **Limitations and Future (5 minutes):**    *   Briefly touch on challenges (data, computational power, 'black box').    *   Outlook: The ongoing evolution.*   **Quick Recap & Next Steps:** Summarize key takeaways and suggest topics like 'Deep Learning' or 'Convolutional Neural Networks.'"
